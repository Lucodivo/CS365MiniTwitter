Mini Twitter Design Patterns Project
------------------------------------
A desktop app that mimics twitter by storing users, tweets, followers, and news feeds.
All users' news feeds are updated the moment their followers post tweets.
Groups can be formed that hold miniTwitter Users and other groups.
The program can also output data like: 
- total number of tweets
- total number of groups
- total number of users
- percentage of tweets that are positive (contain nice words)   
No networking functionality. Purely local dektop program used to practice implementation of design patterns.
